# Town of Babel
March 34th of 2020, the town had just finished building the tallest tower the world had seen. When lil' Frump decides to check up on an owed payment, the tower's effects cause chaos to ensue.

### March 18, 2020
Hey guys it's Dylan again, here with another update. This update brings with it a small change, but exciting nonetheless. That's right, this update marks the completion of Itachi 8ight 9ine. He now has two more abilities in addition to his shuriken throw and basic attack.

#### NEW Abilities (8ight 9ine)
- **Dash:** Better than the player's dash, but worse than super dash.
- **Lunge:** The origin of the player's lunge, basically just a better version.

Along with these new abilites I've heavily tweaked 8ight 9ine's ability cooldowns so that (I hope) the player doesn't feel overwhelmed when facing him.

**NOTE:** Going forward this game has become a passion project. This means updates, while semi-frequent now, will most likely completely stop once once I reach what I consider complete for my first real game.



### March 14, 2020
Well the due date is here and this is what we've got. Only things done after actual due date are a disclaimer and some tweaks.

Hey guys, Dylan here. Before I get into our upcoming updates I want to share our current base features.

#### Player Ability: Dash
Your best friend. This ability, activated by pressing (Space) will temporarily lock you in your current velocity, but also speed you up, shrink your hitboxes, and make you immune to damage for its duration plus a very short cooldown period.
#### Randomly generated Weapons
- Each weapon drop has a rarity, which is tied to its damage. The higher the rarity, the more damage it does!
- Every weapon has a chance of dropping at a higher rarity, be on the lookout for these!
- ##### Abilities
    - Each weapon has the chance of dropping with one of the following abilities:
    - **Super Dash:** An additional dash to your normal one. Better in every way.
    - **Bling Flash:** Stun opponents in a wide area around you.
    - **Boom Speaker:** Push opponents close to you away, some enemies are less affected.
    - **Lunge: (Knife Only)** Lunges the player in their facing direction, dealing double damage and providing immunity while doing so.
    - **Fruitball: (Bat Only)** Smash a fruit in the direction of your mouse with your bat that does triple damage.
    - **Laser: (Gun Only)** Fires a projectile that does double damage and hits up to three enemies.
    - *Ability drop rates change based on rarity and location (street vs house)*
#### Randomly generated Enemies
The enemies in each location are randomly generated for your replayability! Didn't do so hot because a house spawned enemies you hadn't seen before? Just refresh the page for a new run. There are currently five main enemy types, as follows:
- **Dog:** Fast but weak, be careful not to ignore them!
- **Thug (Knife):** Short range but still quick, be warry!
- **Thug (Bat):** More range but slower movement and swing.
- **Bodyguard:** Very slow with limited range but has a long range slow windup stun.
- **Police:** Ranged type with gun, will try to space you. DO NOT IGNORE.
#### Randomly ordered Bosses
Whenever you load up a level for the first time, it will select one of the available bosses to put in its boss house. For the first level this is from all four, then the next level selects from the remaining three, and so on. There are currently four bosses:
- **Slow Dogg:** Wheelchair bound old school rapper. Resident dog keeper.
    - Fires a shotgun and swings with a cane, calls his dogs occasionally.
- **J. Swole:** Goes to the gym a lot, some say too much, definitely more than he raps.
    - Throws out jabs in you get in range, likes to slam the ground with a strong stun.
- **Itachi 8ight 9ine:** Thinks he's a ninja and a rapper, fails at both.
    - Throws shurikens frequently, will slash you if you get to close.
- **Tyson the Caster:** Was given psychic powers by the Tower, now thinks he's the best.
    - Summons a single floating fruit to target you.
    - Summons several floating fruit that orbit him, he will also target you with them occasionally.

#### Future Plans
And now the fun part, what our plans from here are. We do in fact have a final boss planned and with him a fourth level. I don't want to give away too much but I will say he's going to have two phases! Either before him or immediately following (depends on James), the currently existing bosses will get new abilities and redone decision trees. I personally would like to see another enemy added to game (we were thinking suicide bomber) but I don't know that I can squeeze any more out of James than what he's already drawn and will be drawing. I also have plans to add a hard mode to our game, as several veteran gamers like myself find the current iteration too easy. If I can get James to send resources to me I may end up eventually adding a procedurally generated endless mode for the roguelike fans out there, as it was originally intended. Of course along with all of these updates I will be optimizing what I can and changing how things are done because I think it'll work better some new way. If you're really that curious you can follow the updates more closely at [my fork](https://github.com/dhill30/townofbabel.github.io, "dhill30/townofbabel").

**NOTE:** Going forward this game has become a passion project, as the assignment portion of it is complete. This means updates, while semi-frequent at first, will most likely completely stop once once I reach what I consider complete for my first real game.
